	    Hackers Against Racism (HAR) is a non-profit, loosely held
	    group of volunteers offering free IT security assistance and
	    consultation to organizations and individuals fighting
	    racism.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    HAR is not politically affiliated in any way, as we
	    feel that racism is not a left-or-right issue, but something
	    that affects society overall. HAR will not accept requests
	    from political parties or projects that are not directly
	    related to anti-racism.
	  </p>

	<div class="four columns">
	  <p>
	    The group that make up HAR consists of security
	    professionals, developers, security enthusiasts, and
	    others. Some examples of the areas where we can help are,
	    but not necessarily limited to:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Web application security assessments
	    <li>Operational security advice
	    <li>Forensic investigations
	    <li>Secure server configurations
	    <li>Etc.
	  </ul>

	<div class="four columns">
	  <p>
	    If you would like to ask us a question or request our
	    assistance, please follow the link above, fill out the
	    form and we will get back to you.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Please note that since HAR is run by volunteers with day
	    jobs, we may not be able to answer directly. There may
	    also be instances where we cannot help due to resource
	    constraints or other reasons.
