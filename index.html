Hackers Against Racism (HAR) is a non-profit, loosely held group of volunteers offering free IT security assistance and consultation to organizations and individuals fighting racism. HAR is not politically affiliated in any way, as we feel that racism is not a left-or-right issue, but something that affects society overall. HAR will not accept requests from political parties or projects that are not directly related to anti-racism.
<br><br>
The group that make up HAR consists of security professionals, developers, security enthusiasts, and others. Some examples of the areas where we can help are, but not necessarily limited to:
<br><br>
- Web application security assessments<br>
- Operational security advice<br>
- Forensic investigations<br>
- Secure server configurations<br>
- Etc.<br>
<br>
If you would like to ask us a question or request our assistance, please fill out the form <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPjulwce9aQiGpegNI3Px2PRJkRxhVdnAbjmrXMfujAEZ4AQ/viewform"><b>here</b></a> and we will get back to you. Please note that since HAR is run by volunteers with day jobs, we may not be able to answer directly. There may also be instances where we cannot help due to resource constraints or other reasons.
