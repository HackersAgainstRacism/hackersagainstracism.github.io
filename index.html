	  <p>
	    Hackers Against Racism (HAR) is a non-profit, loosely held
	    group of volunteers offering free IT security assistance and
	    consultation to organizations and individuals fighting
	    racism. HAR is not politically affiliated in any way, as we
	    feel that racism is not a left-or-right issue, but something
	    that affects society overall. HAR will not accept requests
	    from political parties or projects that are not directly
	    related to anti-racism.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The group that make up HAR consists of security
	    professionals, developers, security enthusiasts, and
	    others. Some examples of the areas where we can help are,
	    but not necessarily limited to:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Web application security assessments
	    <li>Operational security advice
	    <li>Forensic investigations
	    <li>Secure server configurations
	    <li>Etc.
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    If you would like to ask us a question or request our
	    assistance, please fill out the form <a target="_blank"
						    href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPjulwce9aQiGpegNI3Px2PRJkRxhVdnAbjmrXMfujAEZ4AQ/viewform">here</a>
	    and we will get back to you. Please note that since HAR is
	    run by volunteers with day jobs, we may not be able to
	    answer directly. There may also be instances where we cannot
	    help due to resource constraints or other reasons.
